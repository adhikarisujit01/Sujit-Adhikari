# Project 1: Statistical Analysis Analyzing Factors Influencing Credit Card Approval and Credit Limit:
* Used Python for Data Cleansing process. The data has been imported from Kaggle.
* Performed Exploratory Data Analytics to find the relationship among the variables using python.
* Analyzed different variables using Chi-Square Method
* Built Linear Regression Model in R to find the best combination of variables that define the impact on credit limit.
* The Model suggests that Income, Education Level, Marital Status, and the Number of Dependents are statistically significant while determining the credit limit on a credit card.   Gender is the only variable from the dataset which is relatively lesser significant to credit limit. 


# Project 2: San Francisco Bay Area Housing Market Analysis:
* Used Excel for Data Cleaning Process. Data scrapped from California Association of Realtors site, and Federal Reserve site.
* Used PowerBI and Excel to perform Exploratory Data Analysis. With the help of EDA, different forms of relationships among variables are found out
* Based on the found out relationship among the variables, a linear regression model is created to find out more about the combination of variables that impact the housing market   prices the most. The major factor to influence the housing market turned out to be the median income of the family. 
* To conclude this project, it is suggested that the optimal decision for now is to buy a house in the SF bay area. Also, our model suggests that the housing prices will likely go further go in the future, and the average mortgage rate stays stable before it starts increasing. Therefore, it is still the conduciv time to invest in the San Francisco Bay Area Housing Market.
* One of the interesting finding of this project is that the major influencers in the Bay Area Housing Market are the foreigners and out-of-state investors rather than the locals. 


# Project 3: Airbnb in New York City
* This is the descriptive analytics project to find out the relationship among the factors that influence the Airbnb prices in NYC.
* Data has been downloaded from Kaggle. 
* Python is used for data cleaning process. The data cleaning process required the change of data types, getting rid of null values, identifying outliers and keeping the only       columns we needed for the analysis.
* It has been concluded that it is relatively costlier to stay in Manhattan than in other neighborhoods. The cost of staying in the house/apartments is higher than that of the       private room and shared rooms.
* It is suggested to the Airbnb to target the corporate people in New York City to compete against hotels. There are greater revenue generation opportunities in Manhattan neighborhood than in Bronx and Queens for Airbnb. 

**#Project 4: Master Data Management Proposal**
* Formed a hypothetical company, called ABC company and gave the business value of company as the pet food retailer.
* Brainstormed the possible business issues of the company that might need the installation of Master Data Management Platform. 
* It was decided that the ABC company is looking to extend its product line. The process to take the informed decision if the company has to invest in product line extention is     supported by the Master Data Management Program.
* Key business drivers were found out and it was suggested that the company needed to invest in MDM program.
* Various processes of building the MDM programs are discussed in detail.
