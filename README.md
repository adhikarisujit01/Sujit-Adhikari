# Project 1: Statistical Analysis Analyzing Factors Influencing Credit Card Approval and Credit Limit:
Description: This analysis has shown that Income, Education Level, Marital Status, and the Number of Dependents is statistically significant while determining the credit limit on a credit card. Customer Age is a factor but less of an influence than other factors. In terms of the factors determining the credit card approval, all the variables; Customer Age, Income, Education Level, Gender, Marital Status, and the Number of Dependents are statistically significant, though Gender is much less significant. In short, Gender affects the credit score approval odds least than other factors.
Looking ahead, I would like to build the relationship of the given variables with respect to Attrition Flag. I would like to conduct a thorough hypothesis testing and regression modeling to find out why some of the company’s credit card customers are closing the account. It would be interesting to find if the given variables have something to do with the customer’s decision, or is it a strategical failure of a company to retain the customers?

 # Drillpress and motor kit project:
  The image data along with vibration, temperature data is sent to the backend platform through MQTT broker. Here Raspberry Pi detect the object when machine runs and send near   miss image to the Cat-M1 module through the UART connection. Similarly, vibration and temperature sensors are connected to the Cat-M1 module through the groove connectors and   data along with image data has been sent to backend using cellular connection. The Sprint sim card is the media for cellular connection. The main goal of this project is to     replace the Wi-Fi connection through cellular connection.[Github link](https://github.com/nabin-g/drillpress)(link is private)
