#Project 1 : Statistical Analysis Analyzing Factors Influencing Credit Card Approval and Credit Limit
Description: This analysis has shown that Income, Education Level, Marital Status, and the Number of Dependents is statistically significant while determining the credit limit on a credit card. Customer Age is a factor but less of an influence than other factors. In terms of the factors determining the credit card approval, all the variables; Customer Age, Income, Education Level, Gender, Marital Status, and the Number of Dependents are statistically significant, though Gender is much less significant. In short, Gender affects the credit score approval odds least than other factors.
Looking ahead, I would like to build the relationship of the given variables with respect to Attrition Flag. I would like to conduct a thorough hypothesis testing and regression modeling to find out why some of the company’s credit card customers are closing the account. It would be interesting to find if the given variables have something to do with the customer’s decision, or is it a strategical failure of a company to retain the customers?
